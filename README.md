### Description

This program uses the MAPI controls to interface with Outlook. You can view your address book, send and recieve mail, and do a lot more. This was originally submitted a year ago by me but now i put a screenshot with it. The MAPI control is not in the zip because I don't have it. This was written with VB 5.0 when I still had 4.0 installed. 4.0 came with MAPI, so after I uninstalled 4, I lost MAPI. Please vote for me. E-Mail me at et7809@yahoo.com
